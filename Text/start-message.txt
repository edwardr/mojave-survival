Welcome to Mojave Survival, an enhanced version of Hardcore Mode for New Vegas which greatly increases the challenge of the game. It also introduces a number of new gameplay mechanics while overhauling the vast majority of the base-game mechanics.

Players are encouraged to read the Survival Guide located in the Notes section of your Pip-Boy, as well as the Wasteland Farming Guide and Crafting Guide.
