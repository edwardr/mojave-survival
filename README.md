## Highlights

- **Caravan Network.** Fast-travel between major map locations via a caravan network.
- **Player Housing.** Purchase up to five (5) properties across the map from a property dealer in Freeside.
- **Farming.** Any crop/plant you see in game can be farmed at any of your properties. The farming system requires water, fertilizer, and maintenance. It is entirely optional, but can yield you a reliable supply of ingredients for high-end crafting.
- **Brahmin herding.** You can purchase Brahmin from a dealer near the 188 Trading Post. These Brahmin can live at any of your farms and provide a reliable source of fertilizer and Brahmin milk.
- **Debadged and Reinforced armors.** Any faction armor can be debadged to remove its association with the faction. Many of them also include updated textures to remove faction badges and markings, such as the NCR armor which uses duct tape. Debadging uses the Survival skill. Reinforced armor crafting uses the Repair skill. Also adds the ability to create reinforced versions of many outfit/non-armor articles of clothing.
- **Lore-friendly crafting.** The mod adds in total over 100 new craftable items, including some very powerful high-end food items and dishes inspired by the original Fallout games.
- **New Voiced NPCs**, including a property dealer in Freeside, a caravan master, and a brahmin dealer, as well as a few others that appear in choice-dependent encounters.
- **New Encounters.** The mod adds more than 100 new encounters across the map. Most of which are minor ambush-style encounters that may or may not happen depending on some of your story choices. But it also adds a number of new Wild Wasteland events
- **Companion Updates.** Companions will now use stimpaks and antivenom that you give them. Cass will drink whiskey. All companions can be dismissed to any of your player properties. You can also only have one active companion at a time, whether human or creature (not including temporary followers).
 - **Economy Overhaul.** The economy is much more unforgiving. Most likely you will spend the majority of the game struggling financially, just like real life.
 - **Combat/Damage Changes.** Combat is faster and far more dangerous than in the vanilla game. There are also many more enemies and some new enemy variants.
- **New Conditions / Status Effects**, including: long-term injuries, raw-food poisoning, blindness, drunkenness, Jet speed buff, parasite infection, bacterial infection.
- **New Perks/Traits.** Traits for chronic drunks and Jet addicts, along with some weapon-related perks.
- **Skills / Stat Overhaul**
